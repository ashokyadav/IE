<p>How to Conditionally Target IE10 and 11 There is no question that IE10 and 11 are an improvement from previous versions of IE, but unfortunately there are times when they too need special attention. In order to conditionally target IE10 and 11 we can now use a special media query:</p>

<p>@media all and (-ms-high-contrast: none), (-ms-high-contrast: active) {  // IE10+ CSS here } With the above media query in place you are now ready to conditionally target IE10 and 11. For IE 9 and below, we can continue to use the usual conditional comments.</p>
